Airbnb an acronym for "Air Bed and Breakfast," is a website that links hosts who rent out space in their homes with guests who are looking for a place to stay at a lower cost than a hotel. Airbnb has a number of filters to assist guests in finding an appropriate accommodation(listing), as well as a chat system the bridges the gap between hosts and guests directly, as well as a secure payment system. A host who has a room or an entire house to rent, must register a listing on Airbnb and provide information such as the location, size, number of rooms, and other details, provided all legality involved in listing a rental in your city or neighborhood is met.
I am using the Seattle Airbnb dataset to derive insights for the following questions:

* Is it possible to predict the price of a given room or apartment by using other variables?
* How does the price change based on the type of property being listed?
* How does the price vary based on the location of the property within Seattle?

I will focus on data exploration as a means to derive these insights as well as machine learning for predictions.
All libraries used for the project are within python 3. No external libraries were imported
